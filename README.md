## üöÄ Projects

Here are some of the major projects I have worked on:

### 1. [MCQ-Generator](https://github.com/Adii265/MCQ-Generator)
- **Description**: This project performs text summarization and generates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on extracted keywords from the summarized text.
- **Tools**: Python, BERT, Wordnet ConceptNet
- **Outcome**: 

### 2. [Stock-Price-Prediction](https://github.com/Adii265/Stock-Price-Prediction)
- **Description**: Project involves analyzing time series data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.
- **Tools**: LSTM
- **Outcome**: LSTM with No Seasonality works best for capturing short-term dependencies with minimal complexity.

### 3. [Search-Engine](https://github.com/Adii265/Search-Engine)
- **Description**: Search Engine for Quora Question pairs.
- **Tools**: NLTK, Word2Vec, Cosine Similarity
- **Outcome**: 

### 4. [Character-Level Transformer Language Model for Text Generation](https://github.com/Adii265/Character-Level-Transformer-Language-Model-for-Text-Generation)
- **Description**: A character-level Transformer model designed for generating text by predicting one character at a time using self-attention mechanisms.
- **Tools**: PyTorch, NLP, Transformer
- **Outcome**: Generation of semantically correct words forming sentences.
- **Application**: Most likely keywords used by an author in the next creation.

### 5. [Credit Card Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Adii265/Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation)
- **Description**: Customer segmentation project utilizing clustering algorithms (KMeans, DBScan, GMM, Spectral) to identify distinct credit card customer types based on spending behaviors and transaction patterns.
- **Tools**: KMeans, GMM, DBScan, Spectral Clustering, Calinski-Harabasz Index, Davies-Bouldin Index, Silhouette Score
- **Outcome**: KMeans provided the best-defined clusters with a high Calinski-Harabasz Index (1542.27), while GMM achieved the highest silhouette score (0.27) despite some cluster overlap.
  
### 6. [YOLO Object Detection using OpenCV](https://github.com/Adii265/CNN_Projects/tree/main/Object%20Detection)
- **Description**: This project leverages OpenCV's DNN module with pre-trained YOLO to detect objects, drawing bounding boxes with confidence levels and class labels.
- **Tools**: OpenCV, Yolo
- **Outcome**: Bounding boxes are drawn around detected objects, showing the confidence level and class of each detected item.

### 7. [Fashion MNIST Classification](https://github.com/Adii265/CNN_Projects/tree/main/Classification%20of%20Fashion%20Mnist)
- **Description**: Classifying images into 10 different fashion categories (e.g., T-shirts, bags, and shoes).
- **Tools**: Keras, Tensorflow, openCV
- **Outcome**: The model achieves classification of the Fashion MNIST dataset with performance evaluated through accuracy on the test set, using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer for training.
  
### 8. [GPT-2 for Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Dataset](https://github.com/Adii265/LLMs)
- **Description**: This project fine-tunes the GPT-2 model on a Twitter dataset to perform sentiment analysis.
- **Tools**: Pytorch, Transformers, Numpy
- **Outcome**: The model achieved an evaluation loss of 1.7812, indicating very accurate prediction of sentiments.
